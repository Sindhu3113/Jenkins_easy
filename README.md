### Summary

I learned how to navigate the Jenkins dashboard, where I can see all jobs, the build history, and Mange s. I became familiar with how to create and configure a new pipeline job using the New item option. I also explored how to monitor builds by viewing the build history, checking detailed logs in the Console Output, and using the Stage View for a visual representation of each step. Overall, I now understand how to manage and track build processes easily using Jenkins.
